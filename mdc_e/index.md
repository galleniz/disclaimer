# Batch File
Hello, first of all, thanks for trusting the engine and entering this `.bat` since normally people would think that it is something suspicious, but none of that, everything is tailored so that it doesn't take long to install, some optional libraries were deactivated when just like replacing some things xd.

Keep in mind that this can work and everything, but you will have to check whether or not it is installed correctly because the use of the engine depends a lot on each and every library required.

If there are any kind of problems you can go to [report some error](#bug-report) to avoid any inconvenience you may have in the installation with this batch file.
# Engine uses
If you are in open source, take into account that you lose the vast majority of things about the servers, types of passwords and the possibility of logging in, besides that it would be a bit complicated to make it work xd.

But not everything is gray, you can support with your modifications and we will give you credits in Additional credits, since your change could be significant and could support, since the engine belongs to everyone, for everyone.
